# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

The folders and files contained in this project were created by David Osuchukwu for the Project0 assignment of the edx HarvardX CS50W Web Programming with JavaScript and Python Course.

While some links and buttons may not be functional at the moment (for which I apologize and promise to correct as I go further in the course), listed below are some of the features I've used so far in designing this website:

## /node_modules

- npm dev packages. I've included this folder in the .gitignore file because of excessive changes that were too many for git to keep track of while making commits.

## /src: (sub-folders: assets, scss, js)

- index.html: home page which makes use of some of Bootstrap 4.5.0's (blog) features such as columns, grid, glyphicons etc.
- Three other pages (About, Contact and Gallery) pages all accessible from the navigation menu visible on each separate page.

Note: Some buttons (the "Like" buttons on the Gallery page for instance) and links have been intentionally left inactive at the moment for a lack of time, while I also figure out how to make them work like I want them to as I progress through the course.

## /src/assets

- various images used throughout the site.

## /src/scss

- A .scss file mapping to a .css file containing various selectors for styling specific sections.
- .css file containing variables, @media queries for adding cross-device responsiveness and examples of nesting.

## /src/assets

- empty for the meantime.
